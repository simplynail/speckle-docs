# Supported Elements

As Speckle develops, we are able to build further integrations with each of the applications we support. However, each application, and its API, comes with its own limitations that (alas) no programmer can overcome!

The tables below give an per-application indication of which object conversions Speckle is currently able to support, and to what extent. 


::: tip Not Seeing Support for Something you Want? ðŸ§ƒ

We're working hard to support additional elements. The list below will be updated as soon new conversion routines are added.

If you'd like us to add something specific, let us know on the [Speckle Community Forum](https://speckle.community)! We use community feedback to guide what features we'll work on next.

## Rhino

### Supported Elements

Almost all geometric elements are supported by the Rhino connector. This includes:

> Speckle supports sending BREPs from Rhino <-> Rhino, and Rhino <-> Revit, with some limitations imposed by Revit's API.

### Unsupported elements

Many non-geometric elements and any geometric element not listed above, such as text tags, hatches, etc are not supported.


## Grasshopper

### Supported Geometries

Generally speaking, Revit doesn't support raw geometry as it deals with families. Nonetheless, we've made it simple to receive some types of geometry directly, without the need of specifying family type, name or any other parameter.

| Geometry     | Send | Receive        | Status        |
| ------------ | ---- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Line & Curve |      | As ModelCurve  | `In Progress` |
| Brep         |      | As DirectShape | `Complete`    |
| Mesh         |      | As DirectShape | `Complete`    |

### Non Supported Elements

Various element and data types do not have a direct conversions in Revit. Therefore sending Numbers, Points, Vectors or other non supported elements will have no effects.

To use such data types in Revit you should check our our [Dynamo Connector](/user/dynamo)

:::tip

If non supported elements are received in this connector, no errors are thrown.

## Blender

### Supported Elements

The Blender Connector is still a work in progress and, as such, the conversions to and from Speckle are not yet robust. We welcome feedback, requests, edge cases, and contributions!

- Meshes are fairy well supported
- Breps are imported as meshes using their `displayValue`
- Curves have limited support
